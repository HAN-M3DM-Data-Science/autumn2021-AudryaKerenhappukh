## Why was data driven decision making (3DM) useful in this business case?

Gojek has been growing tremendously throughout Sout Eas Asia for the past decade. tarting as an online taxibike service in 2010, Gojek is now recognized as a supperapp company offering over 20 services (e.g., transport, food delivery, courier logistics, instant shopping, professional massages, payments) on its mobile application. 

With different services Gojek is offering to their customers, 3DM is important for Gojek to improve their performance and services.

The insights they received from collecting a various types of data ranging from bookings and conversion, to mobile user experience have helped Gojek to resolve problems and strive for constant improvement and innovation in their products ("GOJEK'S success story with data-powered strategy", n.d.)

## How did the organization apply 3DM?

As mentioned in the video above, Gojek is partnering with Google Cloud where they are able to receive a ping from their drivers to know their location. This will let them know where drivers hang out together and enable Gojek to optimise drivers' trips so they can pick up riders on the way back (Tan, 2018.  Gojek also signal heat maps so drivers know where they are needed the most. ("GO-JEK Case Study  |  Google Cloud", 2019). 

Using Google Cloud Platform, Gojek is also applying Cloud Machine Learning to effectively predict changes in demand due to events such as change in the weather. 

## What can the organization do with 3DM that they couldn’t do before?

Leveraging their partnership with Google Cloud, Gojek is now able to generate billions of events a day and analyse big data that amounts to 4TB a day (Tan, 2018). From the example mentioned in the previous section, signaling heat maps to their drivers allow them to make real-time decisions on their own. 

Gojek has more interesting data-driven features to grow their business and improve customer experiences as the following examples:

1.    Using machine learning to personalize search results in GoFood (James, 2019)

2.    Using Natural Language Processing to name detailed pickup point, displayed exactly how customers and drivers usually refer to them (Xiaohong, 2020).

3.    Built data-driven narrative to segment and appreciate their customers. This enables Gojek's customers feel good about themselves for being a part of a social cause in helping drivers and merchants (Ambhara, 2021)
